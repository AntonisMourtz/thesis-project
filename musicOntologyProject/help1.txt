Welcome to the Music Ontology Application!

**HELP MENU**

This system allows you to create and manage a music-related ontology using Apache Jena. Below are the available menu options:

1. **Create a new ontology**
   - The user can create a new ontology from scratch.
   - The ontology already contains predefined classes (e.g., musicians, songs, bands), and the user will add individuals to these classes.

2. **Edit existing ontology**
   - The user can modify the existing ontology.
   - Ability to add new data or delete existing ones.
   - Create relationships between individuals (e.g., a musician is a member of a band).

3. **Search the ontology**
   - Find all individuals of a given class.
   - Find the class of a specific individual.
   - Compare multiple individuals to find common elements (e.g., shared bands, roles, or collaborations).

4. **Open Protégé (Works only for Windows)**
   - The program launches Protégé (requires it to be installed on the computer).
   - Protégé is a tool for editing OWL ontologies, allowing visual data management.

5. **Project information**
   - Description of the project and the reason it was created.

6. **Display this file (Help Menu)**
   - The user can read the help file again at any time.

0. **Exit the program**
   - Terminates the execution of the program.
